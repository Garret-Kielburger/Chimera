# Chimera


This is the Android client for the suite previously in development as Three Beasts. This client app creates the UI, including elements and populating data, based on the Manticore (Laravel/Vue) backend, whose repositories can be found on my profile.

Development ceased when Google and Apple decided to restrict automated apps from their respective app stores. The code is therefore aged, and up to use at your own discretion.

At the point of ceasing development, this client was in alpha testing and focus was on updating the backend. Vue was beginning to be uesd to implement the drag-and-drop GUI that would replace the blank fields from the previously working MVP that was driven by Laravel alone.
